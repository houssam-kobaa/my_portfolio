<p>1 THE PIZZERIA PROJECT</p>

<p>the pizzeria project is a sql poject on MYSQL, where i did make only the backend of the project, i have created a database that will take all the data from a website new orders, and classify it by various tables, so by the end we will end up with a structured and based data, that we will use to make any project (the pizzeria) go wilder, by making somme analysis that will detect the problem -that's keeping us from making a fortune out of our project- by analysing every detail about the data using charts to detect little details about every small mis that's effecting big losses</p>
